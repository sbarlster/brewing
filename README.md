# Brewing Stories
Stories of water, sugar, yeast and if lucky alcohol

This repo is a record of our brewing at home. In 2020 I bought a set of homebrew equipment and books with
the intention of brewing a number of beers. Maybe IPAs, wheat beers, potentially twice a year. Nothing too
ambitious.

Here I intend to publish our learnings, the successes (and not successes). Mostly for self infomation so
we can repeat or not fall into the same holes again.
