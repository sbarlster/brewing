# Elderflower Champagne

We were inspired by a friend who introduced us to the process and the resulting wines the year before. Stories of
exploding bottles, sticky aromatic lquid spilling across floors and onto walls, and the resulting powerfully
scented and very lively wines!

## Dates
* Summer 2024 (July) - a little late to the party - we had to search for late blooming Elderflowers, from shaded
copses and other dark and colder area. But we had success. Two supermarket plastic bags of flowers were found.

* Summer 2025 (June) - learning the lesson of 2024 we went a little earlier. And with more liquid. Planning to
  fill around 30 bottles. Have moved to sparkling wine glass bottles and invested in a set of hollow plastic
  stoppers, wire cages and foil tops.

## Recipes

### Summer 2025
Total: 24 litres of water - enough for 30 bottles of fizzy wine. We expect to lose around 4 litres at the bottom
of the barrel.

* 12 lemons (6 sliced, 6 for juice)
* 3kg sugar
* 1 packet of champagne yeast
* 30 elderflower heads - shaken

Warm close to boiling, 7 litres of water, add 2 cool litres to barrel first, then the hot water, then add the 3kg of
sugar and stir until disolved, then add the lemon juice and lemon slices, finally the elderflower heads and stir.
Prepare the yeast in 50ml of warm water for 10mins, then add to the mix and stir.

Cap the barrel with lid and airlock (filled with steriliser). Leave overnight to start the fermentation.

Champagne corks and wire cages...
* [plastic reusable corks](https://www.colchesterhomebrew.co.uk/colchesterhomebrewshop/prod_938976-Champagne-Style-Corks-12s.html)
* [wire cages](https://www.colchesterhomebrew.co.uk/colchesterhomebrewshop/prod_756141-Champagne-Cages-with-caps-12s.html)

After around 3 to 5 days the fermented but still live wine is added to clean and sterilised bottles, with half a spoon
of sugar. The bottles are left for their secondary fermentation in the bottles for a further week, during which time
they pressurise (CO2 is absorbed into the wine creating the fizz) and the sediment drops into the hollow corks. The
theory is that we now freeze the tops (top 5cm) of the bottles, then remove the hollow corks (with the sediment inside
the hollow section), re-apply a new clean cork and attach the wire cage to the bottle and cork.
