# Elderflower Champagne

We were inspired by a friend who introduced us to the process and the resulting wines the year before. Stories of
exploding bottles, sticky aromatic lquid spilling across floors and onto walls, and the resulting powerfully
scented and very lively wines!

## Dates
* Summer 2024 (July) - a little late to the party - we had to search for late blooming Elderflowers, from shaded
copses and other dark and colder area. But we had success. Two supermarket plastic bags of flowers were found.

* Summer 2025 (June) - learning the lesson of 2024 we went a little earlier.
